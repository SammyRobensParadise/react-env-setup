# react-env-setup

### A shell script to automate the setup of a react environment with react router DOM rendering 💻🦾

Using this script will give you the following dependencies built in.

1. @loadable/component `code splitting`
2. react-cookie `browser cookies`
3. react-lazy-load-image-component `lazy loading images`
4. react-lazyload `lazy load components`
5. @material-ui/core `material ui`
6. react-redux `redux store`
7. react-router `redux router`
8. react-router-dom `dom router`
9. react-scripts `react scripts`
10. react-scroll `scrolling`
11. styled-components `css in javascript`

All of which are common dependencies used by myself and industry when creating react apps.
